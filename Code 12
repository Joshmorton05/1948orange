After assuming the presidency following the death of Franklin Roosevelt, Henry Wallace launched a disastrous invasion of Japan leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American boys all while the Soviets further expanded their influence globally at the expense of us and our allies. Wallace’s failure internationally has also been accompanied by a series of failures domestically, with Congress stonewalling any proposed reforms.<br><br>In a shock to almost all observers, Wallace’s unpopularity led to him losing his own party's nomination narrowly to Dixiecrat Richard Russell, who ran on an interventionist, moderately liberal platform that hoped to continue Roosevelt’s legacy. Russell will now have to distance himself from the unpopular incumbent and show the North he isn't just a candidate for the South.","image_url":"https://ibw21.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BB1eXtXq-img-1400%C3%97935-.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852380153262768200/1202455196349759508/gv7mqBE.png?ex=65cd84ab&is=65bb0fab&hm=c3fa3ce2ba3b0a53604b6e8bf9520f767e21123e2061e6b20cec50353983efde&=&format=webp&quality=lossless","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":12,"year":1948,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1948"}];e.credits = "Made by JDawg (discord), influence by original Red™ universe, made by Captain Tom";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":29,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1001,"fields":{"first_name":"Richard ","last_name":"Russell Jr.","election":12,"party":"Democratic Party","state":"Georgia","priority":1,"description":"Richard ‘Dick’ Russell’s rise to party prominence is anything but ordinary.
