After assuming the presidency following the death of Franklin Roosevelt, Henry Wallace launched a disastrous invasion of Japan leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American boys all while the Soviets further expanded their influence globally at the expense of us and our allies. Wallace’s failure internationally has also been accompanied by a failure domestically. Wallace’s attempt to veto the Taft-Hartley bill ended with Congress overriding his veto as well as a failure to pass any significant progressive reforms. <br><br>    In a shock to almost all observers, Wallace’s unpopularity led to him losing his own party's nomination narrowly to Dixiecrat Richard Russell running on an interventionist moderate progressive platform that hoped to continue Roosevelt’s legacy. Russell will now have to distance himself from the unpopular incumbent and show the North he isn't just a candidate for the South.</div>","image_url":"https://www.augustachronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/2013/11/12/NAUG/ghows-GA-1fc1dd35-72b1-409d-b617-33496d9f596e-44ed05c2.jpeg?width=660&height=396&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://aliciaspringer.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/robesonantijimcrowfordstheatrebaltimore.jpg","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":12,"year":1948,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1948 Orange"}];e.credits = "JochCapone on discord";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1001,"fields":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Russell","election":12,"party":"Democrat","state":"Georgia","priority":1,"description":" Richard ‘Dick’ Russell’s rise to party prominence is anything but ordinary.
